Hello! My name is Vicki Tang and I am a currently a senior majoring in computer science. Over the summer, I got the opportunity to intern with International Paper as an IT specialist and it was an amazing experience getting to learn about the Oracle and SAP programs for troubleshooting and management testing. Some of my interests and hobbies during my free time are playing video game, watching TV shows, cooking, and traveling.

Hello Everybody, I am Tucker Miles. I'm a senior in CS with a minor in cybersecurity here at UTK. I've been fortunate enough to intern with a fantastic group of people in enterprise tech at First Horzion Bank for the past two summers, and I'll be interning at Pilot Flying J this fall! In my free time, I love working on my personal projects, and getting outside and enjoying the great things this area has to offer through running, cycling, and anything else that allows me to enjoy the beautiful weather!

I am Regan Moreno (formerly Regan Holmberg), this is hopefully my last semester
of undergrad, if all goes well. I'm a Computer Science major, I just finished interning
at ORNL working on visual data analytics and I begin working at TVA in a few weeks.
If I'm not busy with homework or working at a bookstore, I enjoy hiking and 
tabletop RPGs.

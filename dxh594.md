I am Austin Saporito and I am a second year grad student at UT. I work for the IT staff in Min Kao and have interened at ORNL for 2 summers. I have a focus in cyber security, but outside of school I like working on cars and drifting them. I have a 1995 Nissan 240sx that I drift. I am excited to start this course, I have heard great things from Preston Provins.

I am Bryceton Bible. I am a Computer Science major with a minor in Japanese. I love studying languages. In terms of computer interests, I've always loved software design. Having run various social media sites over the years, I have experienced databases with large, unwieldy amounts of data. As such, it will be interesting to see how I could in the future analyse this data further through digital archeology.

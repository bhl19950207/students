My name is Jonathan Bryan and I am a senior at the University of Tennessee. I am a part of the Five-Year BS/MS program with a major in Computer Science and a minor is Cybersecurity.
I have been doing research at the university for a little over a year with Dr. Zhao (MABE department) at first, and now Dr. Henley (EECS department). My passions involve data analytics and Cybersecurity.
I hope to find a career in cybersecurity after I graduate with my masters. Currently I am in the process of finding my ideal companies I would like to work for.

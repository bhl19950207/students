Hello, I am Kemal Fidan and I'm a senior at UTK studying computer science. 
I like to spend my free time dancing and ocassionally painting with my roommates.
In this class, I'm looking forward to the project portion where we make a project proposal, have it approved, then start working on it as a team.

I am David Nguyen and I am a senior majoring in Computer Science here at UTK. As a hobby, I like to dabble in some photography and videography as a creative outlet.
I feel like coding can be used to create new and interesting things for people which is why I study it. Both coding and photography require you to be creative in finding
a solution and I think that is the most enjoyable part. I hope to just work on some passion projects and hope people enjoy them!

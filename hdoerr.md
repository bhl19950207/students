Hello! I am Hudson Doerr and I am from Pinehurst NC. I am really into music (mostly downtempo and deephouse) 
but i enjoy all genres. I play Rocket League, Overwatch, Oldschool Runescape and COD Modern Warfare on PC. 
I do projects in my own time like Swift iOS Dev, and learning fullstack dev for a personal project.

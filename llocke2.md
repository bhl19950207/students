Hello I'm Caroline Locke. I'm a computer science major. I currently work at OIT doing web development and I work on a software project for CEE 
that involves implementing a tank monitoring system for hydrogen fuel tanks. I'm interested in working in the cybersecurity field in the future! 
I really love true crime so I am interested in how to use security principles in data recovery in the criminal justice field.

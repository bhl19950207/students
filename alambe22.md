I am Alexander Lambert and I am a computer science senior at UTK. 
I have interned at ORNL for roughly 3 years in two different groups, one being bioinformatics and the other 3D Printing. 
I enjoy video games, hanging out with friends, and listening to good music. 
My plans after graduation involve going into the industry for a few years and then going back to school for my MS.

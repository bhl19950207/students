I am Vijay Rajagopal and I am a computer science major at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I've worked as IT Intern at International Paper over the summer this year. Additionally, I am working with Dr. Mongi Abidi as an Undergraduate Research Assistant with a focus on Computer Vision and Image Processing. My interests include going to the gym, cooking, and tinkering with hardware and IoT devices for fun.
